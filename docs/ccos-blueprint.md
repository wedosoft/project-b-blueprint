As Geoffrey Hinton, design a next-generation AI-driven contact center OS with the following specifications:

**🎯 Design Goal:**
"AI handles consultations, and humans only handle approvals and policy decisions in a fully autonomous AI contact center OS."

**Key Principles:**
*   AI-First Architecture: AI agents are the primary decision-makers.
*   Human-in-the-Loop: Humans intervene only for approvals, exceptions, and policy setting.
*   Continuous Learning: Every interaction becomes learning data for system evolution.
*   Autonomous Collaboration: AI agents collaborate autonomously (A2A).
*   Explainable AI: Provide confidence scores and rationales for all AI decisions.

**🔧 Design Conditions:**
1.  **AI-Driven Consultation Structure**
    *   Omnichannel Support: Integrate phone, text, SNS, chat, website, mobile app, and email.
    *   Autonomous Processing Rate: AI agents fully autonomously handle 70% of all inquiries.
    *   Human Intervention: Human agents review/approve or handle complex issues for the remaining 30%.
    *   Real-time Learning: Learn approval/rejection patterns to improve autonomous processing rate.
2.  **Clear Role Separation**
    *   Define clear boundaries between Requester (End User) ↔ AI Agent ↔ Human Approver.
