# Feature Specification: AI Contact Center OS MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-contact-center-mvp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "텍스트 채널 최소 기능 프로토타입 출시 및 검증 - LLM API 연동, 벡터 검색 기반 AI 상담, HITL 승인 UI, 기본 대시보드, 사용자 인증, 실시간 상태 확인"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Customer Receives AI-Powered Responses (Priority: P1)

A customer contacts the support center via text chat and receives instant, contextually relevant responses powered by AI, with human oversight ensuring quality and accuracy.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - customers getting immediate, accurate assistance without waiting for human agents. This demonstrates the fundamental capability of the AI contact center system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting various customer inquiries through the text interface and verifying that responses are generated, relevant, and meet quality standards. Delivers immediate value by reducing response times.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer has opened the chat interface, **When** they submit a question about product features, **Then** they receive a relevant AI-generated response within 3 seconds
2. **Given** the AI has generated a response, **When** the response requires human approval (based on confidence threshold), **Then** the system queues it for HITL review before sending
3. **Given** an AI response has been approved by a human agent, **When** approval is granted, **Then** the customer receives the response with no indication of the approval process
4. **Given** the knowledge base contains relevant information, **When** a customer asks a common question, **Then** the AI retrieves and synthesizes information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive answer

---

### User Story 2 - Agent Reviews and Approves AI Responses (Priority: P1)

Human agents monitor AI-generated responses in real-time, reviewing those flagged for approval, and can approve, modify, or reject responses before they reach customers.

**Why this priority**: HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) approval is critical for MVP validation and building trust. It ensures quality control while the AI learns and improves, making it safe to deploy with real customers.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering AI responses that require approval, logging in as an agent, and verifying the full approval workflow functions correctly. Delivers value by preventing incorrect responses from reaching customers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an agent is logged into the approval dashboard, **When** an AI response is flagged for review, **Then** the agent sees the customer question, proposed AI response, and confidence score in real-time
2. **Given** an agent is reviewing a pending response, **When** they approve it, **Then** the response is immediately sent to the customer and marked as approved in the system
3. **Given** an agent identifies an incorrect AI response, **When** they modify the response text, **Then** the updated response is sent to the customer and the system logs the correction for AI learning
4. **Given** an agent determines a response is inappropriate, **When** they reject it, **Then** the customer receives a fallback message and the agent can take over the conversation manually
5. **Given** multiple responses are pending approval, **When** an agent views the queue, **Then** responses are prioritized by waiting time and customer importance

---

### User Story 3 - Supervisor Monitors Performance via Dashboard (Priority: P2)

Supervisors and administrators access a real-time dashboard showing key metrics including AI confidence levels, response success rates, approval rates, conversation volumes, and agent performance.

**Why this priority**: Essential for validating MVP effectiveness and making data-driven decisions about AI performance. Provides visibility into system health and identifies areas for improvement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating various conversations and agent activities, then verifying that the dashboard accurately displays metrics and updates in real-time. Delivers value through operational visibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a supervisor has logged into the dashboard, **When** they view the main screen, **Then** they see current active conversations, AI confidence trends, approval rates, and response times
2. **Given** conversations are happening in real-time, **When** the dashboard is open, **Then** metrics update automatically without requiring page refresh
3. **Given** the system has processed conversations over the past week, **When** a supervisor selects a time range, **Then** they see historical trends for AI accuracy, customer satisfaction, and resolution rates
4. **Given** an AI confidence score drops below acceptable thresholds, **When** this occurs, **Then** the dashboard highlights the issue with a visual alert
5. **Given** a supervisor wants to drill into specific metrics, **When** they click on a metric card, **Then** they see detailed breakdowns and can filter by agent, time period, or conversation topic

---

### User Story 4 - User Authentication and Access Control (Priority: P2)

Different user types (customers, agents, supervisors) authenticate securely and access only the features appropriate to their role.

**Why this priority**: Required for multi-tenant security and proper separation of concerns. Must be in place before any real customer data is processed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating users with different roles and verifying each can only access their authorized features. Delivers value through security and compliance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user needs access, **When** they complete the registration process, **Then** they receive account credentials and are assigned an appropriate role
2. **Given** a user has valid credentials, **When** they log in, **Then** they are authenticated and directed to their role-specific interface
3. **Given** an agent attempts to access supervisor-only features, **When** they navigate to restricted areas, **Then** they receive an access denied message
4. **Given** a user session has been inactive, **When** the session timeout period expires, **Then** they are automatically logged out for security
5. **Given** a supervisor manages team access, **When** they add or remove agent permissions, **Then** changes take effect immediately

---

### User Story 5 - Real-time Conversation Status Tracking (Priority: P3)

All users can view the current status of conversations, including whether they are being handled by AI, pending approval, or escalated to human agents.

**Why this priority**: Provides transparency and helps manage customer expectations. Useful for optimization but not critical for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by initiating conversations in various states and verifying status indicators update correctly. Delivers value through improved visibility and coordination.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a customer is in an active conversation, **When** they check the status indicator, **Then** they see whether their message is being processed, awaiting response, or in review
2. **Given** an agent is monitoring multiple conversations, **When** they view their queue, **Then** each conversation shows its current state (AI responding, pending approval, human takeover)
3. **Given** a conversation is escalated from AI to human, **When** the escalation occurs, **Then** both the customer and agent interfaces reflect the status change in real-time
4. **Given** an agent has taken over a conversation, **When** the agent is typing, **Then** the customer sees a typing indicator

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI confidence score is borderline (near the approval threshold)?
- How does the system handle when all human agents are unavailable to approve responses?
- What occurs if the vector database search returns no relevant results?
- How does the system respond when a customer sends multiple messages in rapid succession?
- What happens if a human agent doesn't respond to an approval request within a specified time limit?
- How does the system handle concurrent edits when an agent modifies a response while another agent is also reviewing it?
- What occurs when the LLM API experiences downtime or rate limiting?
- How does the system manage conversations that span multiple topics requiring different knowledge domains?
- What happens when a customer disconnects mid-conversation and reconnects later?
- How does the system handle inappropriate or abusive customer messages?
